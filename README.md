<h1>🎵 Billboard to Spotify Playlist Creator</h1>

A web scraping program that automatically generates Spotify playlists from Billboard chart data.


<h2>📋 Project Overview</h2>
This project was originally designed to let users input any date and create a Spotify playlist of the top 100 songs from that day's Billboard chart. Unfortunately, Billboard's historical chart data is now paywalled, so I adapted the program to work with currently available data—the top 200 songs of 2025.

<h2>🔧 The Process</h2>
Getting this working wasn't straightforward. The program initially failed when attempting to process all 200 songs, but limiting it to the top 100 resolved the issue. After that adjustment, it successfully created a playlist on my Spotify account.

<h2>🚧 Challenges</h2>
The biggest hurdles were unclear instructions and poor documentation for the Spotipy library. I spent a lot of time reading through other developers' implementations and troubleshooting my own code before finally getting everything to work properly.

<h2>🚀 Future Improvements</h2>
I'm really happy with how this turned out. There's definitely room to refactor the code for better flow and incorporate some object-oriented programming principles down the line.
